I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride
A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world
(Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see
(Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world
(Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue
(Every moment, gets better
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world (a whole new world)
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
A whole new world (every turn a surprise)
With new horizon to pursue (every moment, gets better)
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
anywhere
There's time to spare
When you share this whole new world with you
A whole new world (a whole new world)
There's where we'll be (where we'll be)
A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)
For you and me
